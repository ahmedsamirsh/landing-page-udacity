# Landing Page Project








### About my project 




In this project I have added 4 other sections. The navigation bar is constructed according to number of sections on the
 page. 

Every item on the navigation bar leads to the correct section in a smooth scrolling. 

The navigation bar disappears 
after 10 seconds of not scrolling and appears again if the user scrolled through the page.

Every section on the page is 
active when it is on top of viewport when the user is scrolling and the background of this section turns black. 

There is a button in the right bottom corner of the page to go to top of the page. This button is hidden when the user is on top of the page and it appears 
only when the user scrolls down the fold of the page.
